# Ruohan ZHAN's project on ADMM/Split-Bregman type training of Deep Neural Networks

This folder is a summary of Split Bregman and Linearized Split Bregman applied to training neural network. Mnist dataset is tested. Reference: Training Neural Networks Without Gradients: A Scalable ADMM Approach. Gavin Taylor, Ryan Burmeister, Zheng Xu, Bharat Singh, Ankit Patel and Tom Goldstein. https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02026

	'\notes' folder contains notes about model, optimization and algorithms.

	'\lsbi-code' folder contains MATLAB code for linearized split bregman training algorithm.
